# OpenTabBackup
A privacy-focused tab backup extension for Chromium-based Browsers

## Planned features
* Locally backup currently opened tabs
* Allow tabs to be restored from a local backup
* Encryption of local tab backups

## Impetus
I have found Chromium's built in Tab Restore feature too unreliable, and have lost my tabs too many times at this point. There are other solutions that tout auto save and restore solutions that would solve this issue, but considering the INCREDIBLY sensitive nature of this data, I am uncomfortable to see none of these are an open-source solution, with some even requiring a user signup. I find this unacceptable and hope that OpenTabBackup will serve as the first privacy-focused tab backup solution for Chromium-based Browsers.

## Disclaimer
This is my first chrome extension build. Utilising this extension will come with two apparent risks
1. While I am honored you would be willing to put your trust in my software, don't! I don't know what I'm doing, let alone being able to guarantee the safety of your tabs. To say otherwise would be dishonest to you. I hope this tool can be part of your repertoire to maximize your efficiency, but it should never serve as your linchpin. Remember kids, practice your best IPsec lessons, always be on your toes. Be alert and ready. 
2. As I mentioned above, I have no idea what I'm doing. I can't guarantee your tabs will be restored 100% perfectly 100% of the time. I can't guarantee I won't mess up the encryption algorithm and I can't guarantee someone won't be able to get in maliciously to your data. What I can guarantee are two things: firstly that I'll do my best to get as close to these ideals as I can, and secondarily I'll always be open to feedback. Data security is a monumental task and I can't do it alone. I hope you will continuously audit my work, tell me when I mess up, and maybe even fix some of my code if you feel generous!

Stay safe out there!
